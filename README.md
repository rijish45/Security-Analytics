Abstract
---------

There are around 1.5 billion malicious connection attempts per day on the Duke network. One untapped area is research into these types of attacks and learning how academic institutions are targeted.  
Duke OIT has deployed honeypots with sensors to collect data which can be analyzed to predict behavior of attackers. A honeypot is a network-attached system set up as a decoy to lure cyber attackers and to detect, deflect or study patterns of hacking attempts.
Through the **STINGAR** project, Duke has also partnered with several other universities who have agreed to deploy this system of honeypots and share the collected data. This enables low friction generation of threat intelligence.

Objectives
----------

1. Find the differences between attacks on cloud and local honeypots
2. Classify honeypots based on generated features and collected data
3. Build statistical models to cluster attacking IPs based on similar features 
4. Make inferences from geographical data
